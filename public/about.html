<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there! I'm Simone, a 31-year-old stay-at-home mum with an adventurous spirit and an 8-month-old daughter who keeps me on my toes. While my journey into motherhood has been incredibly rewarding, I've also been seeking a creative outlet and a way to expand my horizons. That's where web development comes in.</p>

<p>As someone who has always been fascinated by the ever-evolving world of technology and design, I've decided to take the plunge into the exciting realm of web development. It's a world that's entirely new to me, and I'm loving every moment of the challenge. My days are a delightful blend of nappy changes and debugging, baby giggles and coding conundrums, and I wouldn't have it any other way.</p>

<p>My motivation to dive into web development isn't just about acquiring new skills or staying current in an ever-changing digital landscape. It's also about setting an example for my daughter. I want to show her that it's never too late to pursue your passions and dreams, regardless of where life has taken you. And, of course, I'm looking forward to building a better future for both of us along the way.</p>
