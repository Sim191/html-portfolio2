<h1>The Best Movies According To Simone</h1>
<h2>My Top Three Movies Of This Year</h2>
<hr />
<h3>1. Doctor Strange</h3>
<p>Definitely my favourite branch of Marvel movies and beautifully shot.</p>
<h3>2. Ratatouille</h3>
<p>A great heartfelt animated children's film which makes me smile.</p>
<h3>3. Murder Mystery 2</h3>
<p>Both the films in this series are cheesy but fantastic and just so funny.</p>
